# Script about "Run third: User portrait"

## Part #1

1. Created a script that should do the following:

    * asked the user for their year of birth;
    * asked them in which city they live;
    * asked them for their favorite sport.

2. When you click OK, we show a window that displays the following information:
   * their age;
   * if the user specifies Kyiv, Washington, or London, 
     then show them the message "You live in the capital..." 
     and in place of the dots we substitute the country whose capital is the city. 
     Otherwise, we show them "you live in the city...", where the dots are the entered city.
   
## Part #2

   1. We choose three sports and three champions in these sports. 
   2. Accordingly, if the user indicates one of these sports, 
      we show him the message Cool! Do you want to become …? 
      and substitute the first and last name of the champion in place of the dots.

   3. All this is displayed in one window (alert).

   4. If in some case he does not want to enter information and clicks Cancel, 
      show him the message – “It’s a pity that you did not want to enter your …” 
      and indicate that he did not want to enter – date of birth, city or sport.
