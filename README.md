# In this project, I created a simple "greeting" script.

This simple script demonstrates basic user interaction using JavaScript. The program implements the following functions:

1. Creating the right structure
2. Using basic user interaction methods: prompt(), confirm(), alert(), variables and if...else
3. Functionality for requesting a username.
4. Obtaining permission to greet.
5. Permission check.
