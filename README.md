# Script about "Harder loops"

## I wrote loops that do the following:

1. Output the numbers from 20 to 30 through a gap, using a step of 0.5 (20 20.5 21 21.5â€¦.).
2. One dollar costs 27 hryvnias. Output the data with the calculation of the cost of 10, 20, 30... 100 dollars.
3. Given an integer. Output all integers from 1 to 100 whose square does not exceed the number N.
4. Given an integer. Find out if it is prime (a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no other divisors than 1 and itself).
5. Given a certain number. Determine whether this number can be obtained by raising the number 3 to a certain power. (For example, the numbers 9, 81 can be obtained, but 13 cannot).
