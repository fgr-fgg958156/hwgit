# script about "PadString"

### Wrote an implementation of the padString function that takes 4 arguments:

* string
* a number that is the long string that we want to get as a result of the function
* a symbol (a string with a length of 1 character) — which will be added to the string if necessary
* a boolean parameter (true or false) that determines whether to add characters to the left or right (by default, to the right)

When writing a function, it is imperative to check the arguments that we passed, and if there are no arguments, then return a string with an error from the function (return 'some error'). The error message should be different depending on the condition under which the check failed.
The result of the function call should be displayed in the console after the function completes.

### For example:

* Calling padString('hello', 8, '*') will return the string hello***

* And calling padString('hello', 6, '*', false) will return the string *hello

* Calling padString('hello', 2) will return 'he' — if the number is smaller than the size of the input string, you need to truncate the string using the substr method
