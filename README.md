# Script about "User simulator for web application"

First In this script I created 8 variables with the appropriate types:

1. Username (string)
2. Age (number)
3. Is the user verified? (boolean)
4. Registration date (string in date format)
5. User card number (bigInt)
6. Promo code (if any) (null or string)
7. Backup name (undefined)
8. Number of bonuses on the account (number)

Second added in to the script "simulator.js" string "console.log"

Third for each variable, output typeof to check the data types.
