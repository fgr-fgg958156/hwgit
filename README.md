# hw-49 about "Simulating events via setTimeout with subscription (pub/sub)"

TASK: Simulating events via ```setTimeout``` with subscription (```pub/sub```) — without Promises and async/await

Goal: to implement the simplest event bus (Event Bus) in the browser, which can subscribe to events, unsubscribe and emit events asynchronously via ```setTimeout```.

## Restrictions:

* Browser JavaScript only.
* Prohibited: Promises, ```async/await```, third-party libraries.
* Allowed: ```setTimeout```, DOM events for manual inspection.
* 
## Interface to be implemented:

* ```on(topic: string, handler: (payload:any) => void): () => void``` — subscription, returns an unsubscribe function.
* ```emit(topic: string, payload?: any, delay = 0): void``` — asynchronous emission via setTimeout with a specified delay.
* ```off(topic: string, handler: Function): void``` — unsubscribe.
